## 题解

[notes](practice/notes) LeetCode 题解，也会记录我答题过程中对知识点的总结。

----

## 学习方法

1. 仔细研读经典算法书籍（详细书单见后文）
2. 把所有经典数据结构和算法都写一遍
3. 刷题（LeetCode等）
4. 找志同道合的人一起交流学习
5. 参加比赛
6. 。。。

## 推荐阅读

### 基础（<b style="color:red">进行中...</b>）

- ☆☆☆☆☆《算法基础-打开算法之门》科尔曼[算法导论作者之一]（<b style="color:blue">阅读进度20%</b>）
- ☆☆☆☆☆《算法导论》 是一本对算法介绍比较全面的经典书籍
- ☆☆☆☆《编程珠玑I》
- ☆☆☆☆《编程珠玑II》
- ☆☆☆《算法-Algorithms》第四版，普林斯顿大学，这本近千页的书只有6章,其中四章分别是排序，查找，图，字符串，足见介绍的有多么的细致。（**暂时不阅读**）

### 算法演示

- [David Galles 的可视化的数据结构和算法](http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/)
- [酷壳-可视化的数据结构和算法](https://coolshell.cn/articles/4671.html)

### 编程网站

1. [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com/) 全球最大的在线程序评测系统。
2. [OpenJudge](http://openjudge.cn/) OpenJudge是开放的在线程序评测系统 您可以创建自己的OJ小组。

### 笔试刷题必备

- 《剑指offer》
- 《编程之法:面试和算法心得》
- 《算法谜题》
